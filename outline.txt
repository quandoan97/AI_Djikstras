The code will be broke up into two sup problems 
    1. Creating the map to store the nodes and vertices 
        a. take in the inputs from the user to find their source(starting location) to their endpoint(ending locaiton)
        b. 
    2. Using Djikstras algorithm to find the most optimal solution to the given node
